# bash-by-example
## Introduction

Some notes and examples of bash commands and common command line utilities I frequently use from bash.

A lot of the examples here are similar to stackoverflow threads, but here I get to record my favorite solutions and demo why I like them and give some extra context?


## example 16 - psql - probably the best command line db editor

* psql -E or set ECHO_HIDDEN to pg_catalog metadata - VERY USEFUL - [details here](docs/psql-E-or-ECHO_HIDDEN.md)

## example 15 - bash loop with limit $1


I've been struggling with running bash loops with input parameters of the format `{1..$1}` ... this never quite works for me (I've tried a few iterations).

The solution appears to be to use a while loop
```
[root@c7-master vagrant]# cat loop.sh 
#echo $1
i=1
while [ "$i" -le "$1" ]; do
   uptime
   sleep 2
   i=$((i+1))
   #echo $i
done
```
e.g.
```
[root@c7-master vagrant]# bash loop.sh 3
 21:26:02 up 19 days, 50 min,  2 users,  load average: 0.00, 0.01, 0.05
 21:26:04 up 19 days, 50 min,  2 users,  load average: 0.00, 0.01, 0.05
 21:26:06 up 19 days, 50 min,  2 users,  load average: 0.00, 0.01, 0.05
[root@c7-master vagrant]# bash loop.sh 4
 21:26:10 up 19 days, 50 min,  2 users,  load average: 0.00, 0.01, 0.05
 21:26:12 up 19 days, 50 min,  2 users,  load average: 0.00, 0.01, 0.05
 21:26:14 up 19 days, 50 min,  2 users,  load average: 0.00, 0.01, 0.05
 21:26:16 up 19 days, 50 min,  2 users,  load average: 0.00, 0.01, 0.05
[root@c7-master vagrant]# 
```

## example 014 - which: command not found

I thought `which` was part of the standard bash shell, apparently not
```
-bash-4.2$ which psql
-bash: which: command not found
-bash-4.2$ exit                     
logout
-bash-4.2# yum install -y which
Loaded plugins: ovl
Resolving Dependencies
--> Running transaction check
---> Package which.x86_64 0:2.20-7.el7 will be installed
--> Finished Dependency Resolution
```

I suspect `which` is standard for rhel and ubuntu, but maybe not in more minimal docker linux images?


## example 013 - adding an alias


Starting with `projects` directory
```
[~] # ls -l | grep proj
drwxrwxr-x 26 dpitts     4096 feb 13 23:26 projects/
```

create an alias `scripts`
```
[~] # ln -s projects scripts
[~] # ls -l | grep proj
drwxrwxr-x 26 dpitts     4096 feb 13 23:26 projects/
lrwxrwxrwx  1 dpitts        8 feb 18 23:01 scripts -> projects/
```
## example 012 - simple load testing via pgbench

* [yum install postgresql](docs/yum-install-postgresql.md)
* [postgresql13-contrib required for pgbench (plus bse usage notes)](docs/postgresql13-contrib_required-for-pgbench.md)

## example_011 atop - yum install and config
* [yum install atop via epel](docs/yum-install-atop-via-epel.md)
* [atop extra config](docs/atop-extra-config.md)
* [htop-intro](docs/htop-intro.md)

## example_003 vscode-bash-debug_setup_and_brew
- While I've routinely worked with bash directly on the command-line (on a daily basis) for almost the last two decades (in the early days I was using ksh and csh), more recently I've started using Visual Studio Code and a debugger extension
- https://github.com/rogalmic/vscode-bash-debug
- https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/debugging
- There are no new scripts here, but some code samples and I do cover different bash versions, in the context of macosx and using brew (the package manager for macosx) to install a second and newer version of bash


## example_002 bash_random_and_awk_95th_percentile
- generate 30000 random numbers before 0 and 9999
- use awk to sort list and extract the 95th percentile, which should be 'around 9500' +/-100 (i.e. between 9400 and 9600))

## example_001 input_flags to scripts and if then elif fi blocks
- if-then-elif... blocks are suprisingly fiddly in bash scripts so watch out for syntax
