# bash-by-example
## Introduction

Some notes and examples of bash commands and common command line utilities I frequently use from bash.

## example_003_vscode-bash-debug_setup_and_brew
- While I've routinely worked with bash directly on the command-line (on a daily basis) for almost the last two decades (in the early days I was using ksh and csh), more recently I've started using Visual Studio Code and a debugger extension
- https://github.com/rogalmic/vscode-bash-debug
- https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/debugging
- There are no new scripts here, but some code samples and I do cover different bash versions, in the context of macosx and using brew (the package manager for macosx) to install a second and newer version of bash


## example_002_bash_random_and_awk_95th_percentile
- generate 30000 random numbers before 0 and 9999
- use awk to sort list and extract the 95th percentile, which should be 'around 9500' +/-100 (i.e. between 9400 and 9600))

## example_001_input_flags to scripts and if then elif fi blocks
- if-then-elif... blocks are suprisingly fiddly in bash scripts so watch out for syntax
