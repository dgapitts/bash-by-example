# bash-by-example
## Introduction

Some notes and examples of bash commands and common command line utilities I frequently use from bash.

## example_002_bash_random_and_awk_95th_percentile
- generate 30000 random numbers before 0 and 9999
- use awk to sort list and extract the 95th percentile, which should be 'around 9500' +/-100 (i.e. between 9400 and 9600))

## example_001_input_flags to scripts and if then elif fi blocks
- if-then-elif... blocks are suprisingly fiddly in bash scripts so watch out for syntax
