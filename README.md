# bash-by-example
## Introduction

Some notes and examples of bash commands and common command line utilities I frequently use from bash.

A lot of the examples here are similar to stackoverflow threads, but here I get to record my favorite solutions and demo why I like them and give some extra context?



## example_011 atop
[yum install atop via epel](docs/yum-install-atop-via-epel.md)

## example_010 extra_alias_start_stop_postgres
[Some custom extra alias](example_010_extra_alias_start_stop_postgres/README.md)


## example_009 chmod_read_write_exec
[While git does not support write-only access this is common elsewhere](example_009_chmod_read_write_exec/README.md)

## example_008 bash_awk_sum_stddev
[Using awk to calculate sum and stddev](example_008_bash_awk_sum_stddev/README.md)

## example_004 getting_started_with_git

## example_003 vscode-bash-debug_setup_and_brew
- While I've routinely worked with bash directly on the command-line (on a daily basis) for almost the last two decades (in the early days I was using ksh and csh), more recently I've started using Visual Studio Code and a debugger extension
- https://github.com/rogalmic/vscode-bash-debug
- https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/debugging
- There are no new scripts here, but some code samples and I do cover different bash versions, in the context of macosx and using brew (the package manager for macosx) to install a second and newer version of bash


## example_002 bash_random_and_awk_95th_percentile
- generate 30000 random numbers before 0 and 9999
- use awk to sort list and extract the 95th percentile, which should be 'around 9500' +/-100 (i.e. between 9400 and 9600))

## example_001 input_flags to scripts and if then elif fi blocks
- if-then-elif... blocks are suprisingly fiddly in bash scripts so watch out for syntax
